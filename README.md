The core types and functions of iExpr. 

# Functions

+ You can use **iExpr.Core** to define your own expression types by creating different operations.  
+ Also you can use it to *"create"* a simple programming language. 

    > PS: this will be possible in next version.

# Install

```
PM> Install-Package iExpr.Core -Version 0.3.0
```

# Note

The next version is being designed and this document will change soon. Please wait for next version.  
I will put the source code of a sample logic function extension for iExpr soon.
