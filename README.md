+ Author: Stardust D.L.
+ Version: 0.5

The core types and functions of iExpr. 

> Current version is coding thesedays.

# Functions

+ You can use **iExpr.Core** to define your own expression types by creating different operations.  
+ Also you can use it to *"create"* a simple programming language. 

    > PS: this will be possible in next version.

# Install

```
PM> Install-Package iExpr.Core -Version 0.3.0
```

# Note

The version 0.5 is developing. I have changed many things from v0.3 to improve its extensibility. 
Some APIs have been changed. Maybe you can find them in wiki some days later (but it's still **empty** now).
